short_bio: |
  <p>I am now a Ph.D. candidate at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), working on geospatial statistics and public health. My research now focuses on time series analysis, spatial statistics, and machine learning for epidemiological forecasting, particularly in infectious disease modeling. I explore how deep learning, climate data, and human mobility can be integrated to enhance disease prediction models.</p>

  <p>During my master's at Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT), I worked on Automated Machine Learning (AutoML), particularly Neural Architecture Search (NAS), to automate model design and training processes. I also explored federated learning (FL) to enable decentralized model training across multi-source datasets while preserving data privacy.</p>

  <p>Beyond forecasting and automation, I am deeply interested in ML interpretability (XAI), particularly counterfactual explanations, and actively engage in discussions on AI ethics.</p>

  <p>I am always open to collaboration opportunities!</p>

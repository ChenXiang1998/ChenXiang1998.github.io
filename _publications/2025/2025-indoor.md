  Dry eye syndrome (DES) is a prevalent ocular condition influenced by environmental and behavioral factors, particularly during winter season. Indoor microclimates, primarily shaped by spatial configurations, heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems as well as occupant adaptation strategies, have a significant impact on ocular surface health. However, the combined impact of these factors remains insufficiently explored. This study combines knowledge synthesis with empirical investigation to examine how indoor hygrothermal conditions and occupant adaptation behavior influence DES symptom severity in urban households. A structured questionnaire survey is conducted among 437 residents in Zhengzhou, in the heating transitional region of China. Chi-square test and multiple regression analysis are employed to examine the associations between environmental exposures, adaptation behavior and self-reported DES. Findings suggest that the use of air conditioners (AC) or electric heaters, low humidity, proximity to heating sources and poor ventilation are linked to more severe symptoms. In contrast, those who frequently ventilate, use humidifiers, or remain in thermally stable rooms report milder discomfort. Residential characteristics — such as floor level, room size and orientation — also appear to affect symptom patterns. Shared living settings, often marked by warm, dry poorly ventilated environments and behavioral interdependence, further complicate individual DES experiences. Overall, the study identifies the sensitivity of DES to modifiable indoor environmental and behavioral factors, highlighting the need for targeted hygrothermal and behavioral interventions and calls for interdisciplinary collaboration to develop evidence-based, occupant-centered solutions for healthier residential environments.

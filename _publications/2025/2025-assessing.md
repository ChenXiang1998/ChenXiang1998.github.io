  This study demonstrates the strengths and limitations of various methods for dengue forecasting across multiple timeframes. It highlights the best-performing statistical and machine learning methods, including their computational efficiency, underscoring the significance of machine learning techniques and the integration of climate covariates to improve forecasts. These findings offer valuable insights for public health officials, facilitating the development of dengue surveillance systems for more accurate forecasting and timely allocation of resources to mitigate dengue outbreaks.

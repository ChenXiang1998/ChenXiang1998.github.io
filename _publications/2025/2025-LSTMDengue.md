  This study presents a scalable and robust framework for dengue forecasting across Brazil, effectively integrating temporal, climatic, and spatial information into an LSTM-based model. The model’s successful application across Brazil’s diverse regions demonstrates its generalizability to other dengue-endemic areas with varying climatic and epidemiological conditions. By integrating diverse data sources, the framework captures key transmission drivers, demonstrating the potential of LSTM neural networks for robust predictions. These findings provide valuable insights to enhance public health strategies and outbreak preparedness in Brazil.

  Leptospirosis remains a major neglected zoonotic disease in tropical regions, with Brazil bearing a substantial burden. We conducted a national retrospective analysis of confirmed cases from 2010 to 2023 at the microregional level. Spatio-temporal scan statistics identified high-risk clusters, and Bayesian spatio-temporal models estimated annual relative risks (RRs) for total, male, and female populations. A total of 48,190 cases were reported, 80.1% among males. Incidence peaked in 2011 and 2018 and declined during the COVID-19 pandemic. Thirty significant clusters were detected, mainly in Acre and southern Brazil, where persistent elevated risks were observed. Gender-disaggregated analyses revealed heterogeneous patterns across regions. These findings demonstrate marked spatial heterogeneity and gender disparities in leptospirosis risk and underscore the need for targeted, region-specific interventions informed by high-resolution spatio-temporal analysis.

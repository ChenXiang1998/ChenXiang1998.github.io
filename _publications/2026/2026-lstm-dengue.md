  Dengue fever remains a major public health challenge in Brazil, driven by climate conditions, socio-environmental factors, and human mobility. We developed an LSTM-based framework to forecast weekly dengue cases and detect outbreaks by integrating historical case data, lagged climate variables (temperature and humidity), and mobility-adjusted imported cases. Model performance was compared with three baselines: case-only LSTM, climate-enhanced LSTM, and climate plus geographic neighborhood LSTM. Forecasting accuracy was evaluated using MAE, MAPE, and CRPS, and outbreak detection was assessed using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score. The mobility-enhanced model consistently outperformed all baselines, achieving lower prediction errors, better-calibrated uncertainty, and higher sensitivity and F1 scores for outbreak detection. These findings demonstrate that incorporating human mobility substantially improves dengue forecasting and early warning performance. The proposed framework is scalable and adaptable, offering practical value for public health planning and potentially extending to other climate- and mobility-sensitive vector-borne diseases.

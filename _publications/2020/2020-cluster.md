  Urban shrinkage has become a global, local, complex, and multidimensional phenomenon, gaining increasing attention. This study examines nine prefecture-level cities in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) across economic, population, spatial, and administrative dimensions. Using 2008–2017 panel data and DMSP/OLS nighttime light data, a framework of 44 indicators is established to identify shrinking cities.Through K-means clustering and factor analysis, the study categorizes cities into four types: "population-loss shrinking cities" (Zhaoqing, Jiangmen, Huizhou), "comprehensive expansion cities" (Shenzhen), "spatially stable expansion cities" (Guangzhou), and "stable cities" (Zhuhai, Zhongshan, Dongguan, Foshan). Urban shrinkage in this region is driven by natural constraints, weak policy support, inadequate infrastructure, and demographic shifts.
